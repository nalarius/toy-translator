# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
Place all runtime code directly under `toy_translator/` at the repository root—skip an intermediate `src/` layer. Keep core translation logic in focused modules (for example `toy_translator/phrasebook.py` or `toy_translator/pipelines.py`), park CLI helpers in `toy_translator/cli.py`, and share constants via `toy_translator/settings.py`. Put throwaway explorations in `notes/` and small sample assets in `assets/`. Prefer lightweight modules over deep packages so navigation stays flat.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Use `uv sync` to recreate the virtual environment and `uv run python toy_translator/cli.py --help` (or another short script) for manual checks. If a dependency becomes unavoidable, record it with `uv add <package>` so the minimal `pyproject.toml` stays authoritative; otherwise leave the file alone.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Target Python 3.11+, with 4-space indentation, type hints on outward-facing functions, snake_case for functions, PascalCase for classes, and UPPER_CASE for constants. Keep modules lean (<300 lines) and split helpers when they grow large. Use whatever editor formatting you prefer, but keep imports explicit and avoid wildcard imports.

## Testing Guidelines
This toy project relies on manual verification instead of a dedicated test suite. When adding features, include a short reproduction snippet in the pull request description (for example, a `uv run python -c "from toy_translator.phrasebook import translate; print(translate('안녕'))"` command). Keep modules self-checking with docstring examples or lightweight assertions guarded by `if __name__ == "__main__":` blocks when helpful.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Start commit subjects with a short imperative prefix (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, etc.), then detail every meaningful change as bullet points in the commit body. Each bullet should mention the file or module touched and what changed (e.g., `- toy_translator/phrasebook.py: add basic Korean-to-English map`). Pull requests should include the same bullet list plus manual QA notes or sample translations so reviewers can confirm behavior quickly. Rebase on `main` before requesting review.

## Environment & Configuration Notes
Document secrets and API keys in `.env.example`, and load them at runtime via `dotenv` if needed. Never commit personal `.env` files—only reference keys from code and ensure `.env` stays git-ignored. When adding external services, provide a short section in `README.md` with the required environment variables and any `uv run` commands needed for setup.

## Collaboration Workflow
Before writing code, investigate the problem, sketch the design, and review both with the maintainer; do not start implementation until explicit approval is given. After receiving an implementation directive, restate this guideline to confirm alignment, then proceed with the requested task.
